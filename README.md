This is part of my pricing analysis effort against a competitor.

The competitor is very well known in the space for being a leader at catalog-type distribution channels (vs. sales-driven/traditional ones), so after consulting with the sales leaders, I've decided to conduct a price analysis using publicly available data from a catalog website DigiKey.

I collected data in CSV and Excel format and I ingested the data to SQL.

For the analysis, I first wanted to understand how to organize the data - by series, or by power level. I've discovered that for each series, the prices are not far off, so by series is a nice way to approach the problem. 

For the next step, I asked for help from the product and sales team to identify the series numbers for comparable products - which product of ours could fulfill their products' capacity. The result should be like this: "For xxx series, our pricing is 10% more than yyy competitor".

This gave the exec. and the sales team a good idea of how we're priced against the competitor. And decide on (1) If we should attack part of the market by releasing more products. (2) If the current pricing is in line with our strategy. This is especially useful considering the multiple mergers & acquisitions that happened in the past years, where brands of all market positioning were brought under the same umbrella, while prices remained scattered around the place. This helped with One AE marketing strategy.
